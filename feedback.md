# Project 1 Evaluation

## Deployment

**3: Excelling**
> The app is deployed to gh-pages

## Technical Requirements

**3: Excelling**
> App functions with minimal or no errors. You definitely pushed yourself on this. I like the scoring feature! Another feature you could add is to actually create a hangman figurine with images and DOM manipulation.

## Code Quality

**2: Performing**
> Code is well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. Everything is working as it should, but I'd limit the number of global variables used. There's a big risk of error here, especially as your application grows in scale.

## Creativity and Interface

**3: Excelling**
> The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. The animation on the stones is really cool and definitely. The design is really user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing.
